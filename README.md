**Image Classifier with Deep Learning**

**Project Overview**

This project involves developing an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers using deep learning techniques in PyTorch. The classifier is trained on a dataset of 102 flower categories and can be used to predict the species of flowers from images.

**Project Steps**
-Load and Preprocess the Dataset
-Train the Image Classifier
-Predict Image Content

**Dataset**
The dataset consists of images from 102 different species of flowers. Each category contains multiple images of flowers that belong to that species. This dataset is used to train and evaluate the image classifier.

**Dependencies**

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

PyTorch

NumPy

Matplotlib

PIL (Python Imaging Library)


**Project Structure**

**ImageClassifier.ipynb:** The Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the image classifier.

**train.py:** Script to train the model from the command line.

**predict.py:** Script to predict the flower species from an image using the trained model.

**flower_data:** Directory containing the dataset (not included in the repository).

**Implementation Details**

**1. Load and Preprocess the Dataset**
The images are loaded and preprocessed using transformations such as resizing, cropping, normalization, and converting to tensors.

**2. Train the Image Classifier**
The classifier is built using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) as a feature extractor, with a custom fully connected network (FCN) as the classifier. The model is trained using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent.

**3. Predict Image Content**
The trained classifier is used to predict the species of flowers from new images. The prediction is made by passing the image through the model and obtaining the category with the highest probability.

**Usage**
Training the Model
To train the model, run the train.py script:

python train.py --data_dir path/to/flower_data --save_dir path/to/save_model --epochs 20 --learning_rate 0.001 --hidden_units 512 --gpu

**Predicting Flower Species**

To predict the species of a flower from an image, run the predict.py script:

python predict.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg --checkpoint path/to/save_model/checkpoint.pth --top_k 5 --category_names cat_to_name.json --gpu


**Conclusion**
Upon completion of this project, you will have an application that can be trained on any set of labeled images. The network will learn to recognize flowers and can be used as a command line application to predict flower species from images.
